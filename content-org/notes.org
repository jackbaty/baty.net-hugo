Status: Today, I prefer Linux for everything other than photography and messaging. Those are important, so I remain conflicted.

Let me get this straight. To write a blog post, I create an outline in an Org mode file and write the post, which exports to a Markdown file, which exports to an HTML file, which I upload to a server. Got it.

I've added the [[/notes][/notes]] section back to the menu here. I also reformatted the templates for notes so that the full post content is displayed, rather than just the summary. This was more difficult than expected because the PaperMod theme was being clever. Too clever. I almost switched back to the Blowfish theme, but figured it out.

Looks like I'm out of the Leica SL system. I just sold the 70mm Macro lens and that's the last of it. I'll probably miss having a big, interchangeable-lens Leica system, but the Q2 should arrive today and that ought to help take my mind off it.

I am once again using [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]]
for posting here. It's been a minute, but I found my old config and yasnippets, so it wasn't to onerous bringing it all back. So far I'm only doing these /notes this way, but I intend to roll it into the main blog also.

It was -15°F while walking Alice this morning. I tried the doggy boots, but she wasn't having it, so we barefooted it. She must be tough, because I didn't see any signs of her feet bother her.

I don't know why I worry about what kinds of posts belong where or whether they belong at all. No one else cares, why should I? So yeah, these daily posts are going to stay here for the moment, until I decide I was wrong.

Oh, and fuck this entire administration.

I'm back to using a Leica Q2. The constraints are a relief. For now.
#+end_description

Well the entire Leica SL2 kit has been sold, which left me with the GRIII as my only digital camera. I love the little Ricoh, but it doesn't scratch my "Go out and take photos" itch.

I've gone back to a [[https://leica-camera.com/en-US/photography/cameras/q/q2-black][Leica Q2]]. I have previously owned a Q, Q2, and Q2 Monochrom, but eventually sold them due to other urges (mostly for digital M cameras).

Lately I've been wanting something smaller for carrying everywhere. The SL2 is ginormous and heavy. The Q2 isn't exactly /tiny/, but it's much easier to have with me than the SL2. I could have gone smaller with something like a Fuji, or even the GRIII, but I decided to stick with the Leica. I'll still have the GRIII for when I don't feel like carrying a camera, but the Leica goes everywhere else.

28mm is challenging for me, but I'm unashamed to crop when needed, and the 47MP sensor gives me plenty of leeway. The 1.7 Summilux is a great lens. The clever macro switch is a joy to use. It's easy and intuitive to switch to manual focusing, which I do a lot. I can live with 28mm.

Add weather sealing, IBS, and super simple button/menu layouts, and it really is a great combination.

I admit being tempated by the newer Q3, but new ones cost $7,000, and even used copies are still twice what I paid for the Q2. I got a very good deal on my camera, so I'm happy with that.

I like not having to decide which digital camera or which lenses to bring every time I leave the house.

#+begin_description

#+end_description

I've been alternating between Linux (Fedora/KDE) and macOS since the beginning of the year.

I'd describe Linux and the software running on Linux like this:

Less polish, more power.

What I find challenging is that sometimes I want the power, other times I want the polish.

Surprisingly, I am starting to prefer being /in/ Linux than being in macOS. Linux feels like it's mine and I like that feeling. Everything in the OS makes me believe it was done with me mind. "Me" being "the user". Even when things are frustrating, I usually understand why. macOS used to feel this way, but has drifted from it. It's not all Tahoe's fault, but it certainly hasn't helped.

What I miss most about running macOS is not macOS. It's the software. The polish.

Most of the stuff I use on Linux also works on my Mac. That doesn't apply the other way around. Whenever I discover some cool new app and find that it's macOS only, it stings a little.

I want BBEdit and Tinderbox and Keyboard Maestro and Things and iA Writer and Preview. There are usually "equivalent" apps on Linux, but they're not really. They do mostly the same things, but they're not the same. Not even close. It's been hard to adjust.

The other glaring omission on Linux is an easy way to share things with family and friends. How am I supposed to send funny memes to my wife when I have to jump through so many hoops first?

KDE Connect would be a great solution, but every other time I want to use it, the computer can't see my phone, or vice versa. By the time I cycle wifi on both devices, the moment has passed. Maybe I'll try talking everyone into switching to Signal. Ha! There's no chance of that, so I'm on my own here.

If we're keeping track, I'm writing this in Emacs on the Linux desktop. It's where I'll probably end up full time eventually, but it's not happened yet.

**** DONE Blogging with org-mode and ox-hugo again :blogging:hugo:orgmode:

#+begin_description
Using an SSG for building a blog isn't complicated enough, so I added a layer of Org mode atop mine.
#+end_description

For a few years (a few years ago) I wrote all my blog posts using one big Org mode outline and let [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] generate the Markdown files for Hugo. I eventually decided it was a layer of abstraction that I didn't need, so I fell back to writing in Markdown directly.

I'm really into using Emacs for everything again (still?), so I dusted off and updated my old ox-hugo config and here I am, typing this with Emacs in a big Org mode outline.

I have a (ya)snippet for generating the posts, like so:

#+begin_example emacs-lisp :exports code
# -*- mode: snippet -*-
# name: Hugo blog post
# key: blog
# uuid: blog
# --
,**** TODO ${1:title}
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: index.md
:EXPORT_HUGO_BUNDLE: `(format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d")`-${1:$(replace-regexp-in-string " " "-" (downcase yas-text))}
:EXPORT_HUGO_SLUG: ${1:$(replace-regexp-in-string " " "-" (downcase yas-text))}
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :coverCaption ""
:END:

,#+begin_description

,#+end_description

$0
#+end_example

The snippet prompts for a title, then creates the appropriate properties for the post.

One nice thing about this is that once the Markdown is generated, I no longer /need/ the .org file. Writing this way is a bonus, but not a requirement.
