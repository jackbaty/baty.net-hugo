The thing I tried yesterday (Bear, iA Writer, and Day One) fell apart immediately this morning after I created this daily file in Emacs and started typing without even thinking about it. How am I ever going to extract myself from the clutches of Emacs if I keep using it by default? [The Gravitational Pull of Emacs](/2024/06/the-gravitational-pull-of-emacs/) strikes again. Besides, every time I try leaving Emacs I can't get past the guilt of abandoning more than ten years of experience, just so I can try something different or easier.
