I've spent time this week trying to wrangle [Johnny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com) into something I can use. It's a great system, but I don't know if I'll be able to stick with it. It's me, not J.D. Yesterday, I was doing some AI-assisted searches in my Apple Photos library and started thinking that at some point, won't AI be able to organize my files for me? Then I found [Sparkle](https://makeitsparkle.co), which claims to do exactly that. It sounds great, but no way I'm paying $20/month for the privilege. Someone will eventually create a free, local-only version of this and then I'll be interested. In the meantime, maybe I won't bother spending so much time organizing my files.

I started a blog post about my recent futzing with Johhny Decimal and Obsidian and Bear and so on, but I'm so tired of all that that I quit. Merging my J.D index (now called a "JDex") with a folder full of notes is what I want to do, but the best option for that is Obsidian, and I just can't make myself use Obsidian. I know this, but keep trying anyway for some reason. Then, I tried rebuilding the thing in Emacs with Org-mode documents and that felt better but was actually worse in practice. Finally, I tried importing the "Life Admin" starter into Bear. That felt better, but now I'm back to maintainin an index and a folder hierarchy. It's all too much. I've started just making new notes in Bear wherever and whenever the hell I feel like it. Then I move on to something else instead of over-thinking where shit goes. It's exhausting and I need a break.
