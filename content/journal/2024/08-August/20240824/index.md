Abandoning the hours I spent making little scripts and shortcuts to do the things I normally do in Emacs, but in Bear, etc. instead, I spent time yesterday doing the same thing with the Emacs versions. I feel better about that, because I'm better at Emacs to begin with, so this feels like adding on to something I have rather than starting over with something new.

Speaking of Emacs, I've added evil-mode back into my Emacs config. Now I'm really confused. I have two conflicting sets of muscle memory, both of which I quite like, but they can't really coexist peacefully. I tried Demon-mode and other kinda-evil-but-not-really modes and none are what a want. I'm going to need to decide.
