Busy day today. We're moving Ella into her new apartment. I've been taking it easy since hurting my back last week, so I feel like I'm good enough to be useful.

The best thing about being busy is that it prevents me from second guessing my move to Hugo for the blog. I love that I'm here in Emacs typing this post, but the threat of some update breaking things, or that I break things, looms. And It's mostly stock PaperMod theme, so this is just another boring blog that looks like a lot of other boring blogs. It's fine for now.

How does the divider look? I'm trying it as a way to separate the "ideas" here in these daily posts, when there's not enough to justify a heading. I thought about using something more ornate, but maybe a simple line will do. Should I devise some sort of CSS mechanism

The challenge now is deciding whether to keep posting to [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net). The ellusive "I have one blog" dream could be one step closer if I could only contain myself to posting these daily notes here on Baty.net. Fewer moving parts and all that. The problem is that here I don't get individual entries for each note. It's a wall of daily text. Not sure how I feel about that. Won't these just get lost in the flow? Probably, but does it matter? I mean, c'mon, it ain't Shakespeare.
