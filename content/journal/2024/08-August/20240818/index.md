Managed to get my stepdaughter moved into her new apartment yesterday, and without further damage to my back, which is nice. It went well, and the new place looks great.

I finally tossed my t-shirt from Roger Waters' 2012 tour of "The Wall". The Wall was released while I was in high school and I listened to nothing else for like an entire year, so seeing it performed in full was such a great experience. It was a hell of a show.

My wife just went through and froze her credit report on all 3 services. It was a piece of cake. I froze mine in 2015 and at that time it was still a nightmare. It also used to cost money. Some things do get better.
