Certain software tools click with me. TiddlyWiki, Emacs, BBEdit, and OmniFocus are the ones that I am thinking of right now. I love them all.

I write here nearly every day, but what's it for?

Speaking of clicking with software, I do not click with Obsidian. After seeing another new error when using Emacs this morning, I thought I'd move some stuff into Obsidian, hoping that maybe this time it would stick. It didn't. The whole experiment lasted about 3 hours. Sometimes I just want things to be easier for a minute, which things like Obsidian, Bear, etc. are good for, but I don't know if I'll every leave Emacs.
