I see a lot of criticism of <mark>Tesla's new taxi design</mark>. Specifically, everyone seems confused that it's a 2-seater. Ridiculous! Now, while I'm critical of _everything_ Tesla, I haven't seen anyone asking how many passengers the typical cab ride accommodates. Is it 2, maybe? It could be that Tesla did the research. Anyway If I need more room on a specific trip, I can alway call an UberX.

The latest Lightroom update includes <mark>Smart Albums</mark>, finally. I keep giving up on Lightroom and going back to Capture One, but C1 can be very laggy and it's driving me nuts. Lightroom is fast, and the library/sync is really nice, and improving all the time. I'm so confused.

But I wish Generative Remove was never invented. It's too easy and too tempting.

Is it just me, or does it seem like the entire FOSS movement is crumbling?
