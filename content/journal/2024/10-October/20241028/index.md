With apologies to Groucho Marx...

I don't want to work for anyone who would hire me via LinkedIn.

> I read a post recently where someone bragged about using kubernetes to scale all the way up to 500,000 page views per month. But thatâ€™s 0.2 requests per second. I could serve that from my phone, on battery power, and it would spend most of its time asleep.

I can always tell when someone is unserious about software by how much they complain about a "lack of updates". They're just bored and want something new to play with.
