I removed the "Open to Work" label from <mark>my LinkedIn profile</mark>. Not because I'm not open to work, but because I truly can't stand being anywhere near LinkedIn. The type of people who would hire me are just as likely to find me elsewhere.

Do people prefer these once/day combined posts, or would they rather see them individually (as seen on daily.baty.net)? I feel like most of the individual notes aren't useful enough to justify their own slot in someone's RSS reader. On the other hand, it's nice being able to link directly to any of them.

If I could stop bringing new things in, I wouldn't have to worry about where to put them.
