I'm not saying anything new, but I feel like we've lost the battle for having good and useful products and services. Is it just me, or does every product seem to only grudgingly accept the actual user as a necessary evil? We're secondary to whatever is actually making the money. Call me a grumpy old man, but I hate this trend. "Enshittification" is an over-used meme word by now, but I can't think of a better one.

More like "Fed-UP-verse" amirite?

On days when I feel like "doing something different", I tend to stick to the same circular routine of either switching cameras or text editors or note-taking tools or email clients or blogging platforms and so on. I wish instead that I would _create_ something different. Something new.

Some reasonable points. Some not so much. Mostly it feels overly defensive. One person's "silly sweeping statement" is another's valid opinion.
