I'm so mad at Emacs right now. It's so frustrating when something stops working for no reason I can fathom. I sync everything related to my Emacs config via Syncthing, and the Emacs version is identical, and yet doom-modeline fails to load on the MBP but works fine on the Mini. It's crazy-making and I can't figure it out. 

UPDATE: I had to re-install the "f" and "shrink-path" packages for no apparent reason. I still hate not knowing why things broke in the first place. Makes me want to throw in the entire Emacs towel.

The whole "Check your Halloween candy. I just found [some crazy thing] in a Snickers" thing is tired already.

Today's Emacs etc. fiasco reminded me of [this day in 2020](/2020/02/my-day-so-far-in-roam-and/or-emacs/).
