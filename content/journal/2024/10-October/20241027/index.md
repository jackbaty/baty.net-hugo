## Notes for October 27, 2024

Well, we're back on Hugo. I'm sorry. I like how the PaperMod theme looks and works and feels, more than I like the hand-made thing I was using with Eleventy.

----

I just noticed that I was using a /journal/ prefix to URLs with Hugo, but removed that on the 11ty version of the blog. This of course has broken existing links to journal entries. I'm ignoring it, but it'll bug me soon.

----

I'm bored already.

----

Emacs feels right. Obsidian doesn't. I don't know what else matters.

----

One thing about switching between different static blogging tools is that the mechanism for writing and publishing doesn't change. I type in Emacs and then type "make deploy" in a terminal. Same old.
