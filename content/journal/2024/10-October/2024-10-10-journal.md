My problem is that I love different software for different reasons. I love Tinderbox, Emacs, and TiddlyWiki equally for taking notes. Today I've been testing The Archive again, because it does certain things really well. Sometimes I use all of them in a single day. It's not an effective or efficient way of working, but my love of wonderful software makes it difficult for me to avoid the behavior.

> If you’re going to blow a massive sum on one huge thing, why not a thing that people who don’t know you personally can experience and evaluate and maybe even enjoy? Better “Megalopolis” than a yacht, or a Vermeer locked away in a New York townhouse.

Right!
