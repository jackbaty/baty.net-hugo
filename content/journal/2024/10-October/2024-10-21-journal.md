I noticed that the "cover" images for my posts aren't showing up when reading my feed in [Elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed). It's because I use absolute URLs without a hostname. Other readers, like NetNewsWire, prepend the hostname automatically. I don't think I'll fix it yet, because using full URLs makes me twitchy, because I'm me and I move things.

I've been re-discovering [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com). My wiki ([wiki.baty.net](https://wiki.baty.net)) contains nearly 4,000 "tiddlers", beginning in 2018. There is so much _stuff_ in there that I search it almost daily. I've drifted away from using it for new stuff, probably because I'm all-in Emacs for notes ([howm](https://kaorahi.github.io/howm/), specifically) and I've been publishing my daily notes at either baty.net or daily.baty.net. Now, though, I'm remembering how great TiddlyWiki is for exactly the sort of things I want to record and share. So, I'll be spending more time there for a bit.

Remember when I used [wttr.in](https://wttr.in) to pull in the forecast in ascii?

```
      \   /     Clear
       .-.      +13(12) °C     
    ― (   ) ―   ↗ 12 km/h      
       `-’      16 km          
      /   \     0.0 mm      
```

If I were to let someone else manage my blog, I'd probably go with [Pika](https://pika.page). Not that I'm considering it :). Anyway, there's no search, yet, which makes Pika a non-starter for me.
