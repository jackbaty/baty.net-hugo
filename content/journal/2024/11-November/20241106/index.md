What have we done?

In 2016 I was shocked and disappointed. This time, I feel anguish and hoplessness. I have to believe this will pass, just as it did the last time. An old man getting older always ends the same way. And time does that thing that time does, but JFC how did this happen? My mental model of the world and the actual world no longer align.

I thought maybe I'd give up on blogging for a while, but this is one of the few things that helps.
