I hope you're voting for Harris today. Other than that, I'm shutting my political brain down for the rest of the day. My heart can't withstand this level of sustained anxiety.

I have a lot of anxiety around flying, so before and during a flight, my brain and body sort of shut down and go into internal, primary-systems-only mode.

That's how I'm reacting to the election.

This is mostly because of two things:

1. Things will probably be OK, but they _could_ end in catastrophe.

2. Once we take off, the results are completely out of my control.

It's terrifying.
