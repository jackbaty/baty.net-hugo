I just dropped in and scrolled through the feed on LinkedIn. If LinkedIn is the game I'm forced to play, then I forfeit.

So many people seem to travel around looking only for red flags. Maybe they should spend more time looking for green lights.

A few weeks ago, my Dad's Apple Watch (Series 3) died, so I gave him my Series 7, since I was hardly ever wearing it anyway. Then last week I started reading "Younger Next Year" and all they talk about is doing aerobic workouts six days a week and closely monitoring my heart rate. Lacking an available heart rate monitor, I ordered a new Series 10 Apple Watch. I had to. HAD TO.

Speaking of "[Younger Next Year](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f3848f88-e9cf-4890-a8ba-46a53df71bec)", they're doing a good job of convincing me that what I've been doing is not helping. By "what I've been doing," of course I mean, "Almost nothing". I really hate exercise, but I also really want to be healthy when I'm 80, assuming I live that long. So, I've worked out 4 days in a row so far, which might be a record for me.

Social media is umatched as a method of letting me know what and whom I'm supposed to be mad at right now.
