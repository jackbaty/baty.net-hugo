The smartest thing for me to do would be to double down on using Org Mode for all of my notes and be done with it. I re-installed Logseq last week but haven't launched it. Today, I downloaded Standard Notes but didn't even install it. See? I'm getting better!

Whenever I read posts raving about Emacs, they focus too much on "efficiently editing text". I barely care about that and they shouldn't either. Actual _editing_ comprises about 5% of writing[^guess]. Making that tiny slice 20% more efficient adds almost nothing, if you're looking at the big picture. Efficient editing is _fun_ though, so I'll give you that.

Finally got around to ordering [The Notebook: A History of Thinking on Paper](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9c00cf97-6058-4d19-a825-ba986c83bda1). Should arrive tomorrow. I expect to declare I'm "going all-in on paper" within the next 48 hours.



[^guess]: This is a 100% made up guess.
