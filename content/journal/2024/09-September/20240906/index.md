### Notes from today

How every news article about a court ruling sounds to me:

"Court refuses to overturn rejected ruling not banning those refusing to undo denying a double negative."

I'm feeling the urge to keep daily notes here. Remember when I used to separate long-but-not-enough-for-a-separate post notes with a heading? And the table of contents adds a nice touch, I think.

### Freddie deBoer - The Temporal Copernican Principle

I often vigoriously disagree with Freddie deBoer, but I also often love how he puts things. In [The Temporal Copernican Principle](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/the-temporal-copernican-principle), he considers Yuval Noah Harari to be a charlatan, and says this about his continual optimism around technology:

> Lately, Harariâ€™s interest has (of course) been in AI, insisting as so many do that contemporary systems primarily used to generate B- essays for lazy college students and logos for fantasy football teams are, somehow, going to orchestrate the most consequential revolution in the history of our planet, and soon.

I mean, right?

And then:

> The value associated with improvements to fossil fuel extraction, electrification, modern plumbing and sanitation and hygiene, drug development, motorized vehicles, germ theory, flight, telecommunications, etc, that were born from 1830ish to 1970ish are just immensely more consequential in human terms than the iPhone.

I tend to agree.
