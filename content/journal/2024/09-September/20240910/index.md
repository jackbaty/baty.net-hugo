In high school, I mowed lawns for extra cash. I remember vividly the time I was mowing our neighbor's back yard and I had the idea for a painting (see above). I actually stopped the mower and went inside to start painting immediately. I miss feeling so creative that I'd stop whatever I was doing because I had an idea.

Had second sewing class yesterday. We made drawstring bags. Well, tried to. I struggled with the sewing machine for half the class. It kept jamming. And when it wasn't jamming, I was mis-threading it. We cut several pieces of fabric for the first time. That was harder than I expected. Like my dad often said while building something, "I cut it twice and it's _still_ too short." I didn't finish. I still need to make and thread the drawstring.

Early this year, I decided I was [Hanging up the Hobonichi](/posts/2024/02/hanging-up-the-hobonichi/). As is normal for me, I changed my mind and ordered the [2025 Techo](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2025/pc/detail_cover/pb25_jan/), just in case. FOMO, mostly.

You can't read the room if you're not _in_ the room.

I was considering bringing back [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co) for generating posts here, but according to [this comment](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/709), he plans to remove support for YAML frontmatter, and I'm not using TOML, so that's a no-go.

I feel like if Apple just said "Screw it, we're sick of this" and stopped making iPhones altogether, we'd all just go buy some Android phone and it would be fine. Then maybe we could collectively shut up about Apple and that would be even better.
