I'm having a lot of trouble staying away from social media. The idea was to limit myself to checking once or twice a day, but I still find myself reaching for it every time there's a lull in my thoughts or as soon as I finish something. It's insidious. I'm convinced that social media is bad for my brain and it's _definitely_ bad for my attitude. I'll keep trying. I don't think I should even allow the once-a-day checking. Perhaps I'll bookmark just the notifications tab and check that, since I don't want to be rude and not respond to people.

I dare you to read the [Denote manual](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote) and not feel 100% like it's software you can trust. Prot is just so damn thoughtful about everything.

What would my brain feel like if I didn't have the urge to share every single thing I do or think? Better, I bet.

Haven't settled on whether to continue combining notes into these daily posts or to split off certain ones into Micro.blog or Tinderbox. Or even as small separate posts here. I like all of the approaches, so it comes down to my mood.
