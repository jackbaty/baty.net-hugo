## Today

It bugs me that I'll be in New Orleans next weekend, and I don't have any plans around cameras. I'll probably bring the little GRIII and that's it. I'm not interested in lugging the SL2 everywhere. Nor do I feel like dealing with the hasseles of traveling with film. I'm disappointed in myself over this.

Well, once again a Hugo upgrade broke rendering of the site. Apparently, they've decided to enforce a specific date format or formats in the front matter. Fortunately, I only had a few old posts with a "bad" format, so fixing things wasn't difficult. Still, using Hugo is not my favorite part about publishing this blog. I will do my best to calm down and not do anything rash, even though I'm tempted to do something rash.

Autoplaying video ads should be a jailable offense. At the very least I should be able to come to your house and kick you in the crotch.

I'm more likely to go back to using Roam Research than I am to Obsidian. Weird, huh?

## What would it take to move back to Kirby?

After having a bit of a hissy fit this morning about Hugo, I almost moved this blog back to Kirby CMS. Almost. Since then, I've taken a deep breath, stepped back, and thought about what it would take to make me move back from Hugo to Kirby.

- How can I have URLs like `/YYYY/MM/post-slug` without complex routing that I don't understand? The connection between content location and URL is too tight, IMO.
- New posts/journals should go where they belong, without code changes. I still have to update the blueprint YAML every month to e.g. change from "2024/09" to "2024/10" otherwise new posts and journal entries go in the wrong folder. I don't know how to fix this.
- Better deployments (code vs content). I would like a better way to manage content vs code changes.
- Can I just list all the posts in the panel? Currently, I have to view the current month's post, then navigate "up" in order to just see a simple list of posts. I'm sure there's an easy way to handle this, so why don't I know how?

Most of all, it would take a stronger desire to build everything myself. It often feels like Kirby makes the hard things easy and the easy things hard. I'm not in the mood for that right now, so I will probably tough it out with Hugo for a bit longer. As nice as Kirby's panel can be for managing content, I'm more likely to jump back to Blot or Ghost, to be honest.
