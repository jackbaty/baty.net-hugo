## Notes from today

Have you ever looked into your completely disheveled pantry and said, "That does it! I'm fixing this right now!"? I did that today. After two hours of, "What the hell is this doing here?", everything that doesn't belong in the pantry is not in the pantry, and everything that remains in the pantry is where it belongs in the pantry. This feels really good.

## More on Micro.blog
I'm a week into my [Micro.blog Revisited](/posts/2024/08/micro-blog-revisited/) experiment and have not come to any conclusions. There are two questions I need to answer:

1. Do I need a separate micro/daily blog?
2. Should that blog be run at [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net) or [jack.micro.blog](https://jack.micro.blog)?

The more I continue to enjoy using the Hugo blog, the less I feel the need for a separate blog. If I could simply make the call that I only have One True Blog, things would become much easier.

Sometimes, though, I want to quickly and easily share an image or quote or link. That's where Micro.blog shines. Plus, it will syndicate to my social media accounts. Micro.blog also federates nicely with Mastodon, etc. Seems like a no-brainer.

But! My Tinderbox blog is the result of a long slog of wrangling Tinderbox into building the blog I really want. It works great for that, now. Plus, it's in Tinderbox, which is one of my all-time favorite bits of software. Plus, I control the entire stack. And I can syndicate using something like [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app).

The answer is that I don't yet have an answer, so I'll continue tinkering until I do[^answer].

[^answer]: Which may be never.
