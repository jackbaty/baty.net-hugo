I think I'll (reluctantly) stop using Capture One and go back to Lightroom. I was [using Lightroom for a while](/posts/2024/06/how-im-using-lightroom/) because it's good and keeps getting better, but I get the best results from and prefer using C1. However, it has become so slow as to be unusable. It can take 3 or 4 seconds to update the preview after moving a slider, which is maddening. I've done all the recommended things to improve performance, but nothing helps. Lightroom updates immediately. Plus Lightroom syncs, has modern features that non-professionals use, and is relatively inexpensive.

Me too, Mike.

I'll go on record saying that I prefer pre-recorded events. I suffer from some kind of empathetic anxiety around live events. I spend the whole time thinking, "Don't screw up, don't screw up". It's also why I prefer movies to plays, probably.
