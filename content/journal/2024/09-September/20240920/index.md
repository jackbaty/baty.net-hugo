Yesterday, I tried talking my dad through authenticating the Bally Sports app on his Apple TV. It involved going to a web page on his phone, logging in, and entering a code. It was the worst experience possible. Have you ever tried editing a long URL on an iPhone? Have you ever tried helping an 82-year-old do it over the phone? Technology is terrible. All he wanted to do was watch the ball game.

I broke down and bought a Blackstone Griddle. Today, I made my first smash burger. I'm happy now.
