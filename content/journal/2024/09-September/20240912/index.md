I'm still undecided about where to put small posts. It's easy to put them here, collected into a single daily note, but things feel like they get lost this way. I tried getting back into Micro.blog but that's just confused things more. Plus, I'm in a "control the stack" mood. I'll either end up continuing to put everything here, or I'll split small posts off to [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net) using Tinderbox. The individual Tinderbox posts can then be syndicated via [EchoFeed](http://echofeed.app) to [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@jbaty). Still noodlin' on it.
