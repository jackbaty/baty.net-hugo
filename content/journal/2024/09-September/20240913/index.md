I used Emacs to create this file and now I'm editing it using iA Writer. As much as I love Emacs, I don't necessarily need to spend all day, every day in there, you know? I also wanted to check out the iA Writer update because they now use a sensible UI for navigating folders. The old way made me ditch iA Writer, as much as I love the actual editor.

I took a week or so off social media but have been unable to maintain my distance. The trick is to limit myself to checking the feed a couple times a day. There's so much great stuff out there, so I don't want to leave completely, but I have to stop reaching for it every time there's a lull in my thoughts.

Posts here are no longer being automatically syndicated to Mastodon via EchoFeed. I want to control when they show up on Mastodon, and that may be different than when I publish them here.
