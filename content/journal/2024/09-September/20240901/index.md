I need to step away from social media for a minute. [Adam  of social.lol](https://social.lol/@adam) is, far as I can tell, a terrific person. He has an inclusive, friendly, and welcoming attitude and I've been a happy user of his services for a long time.

However, [this thread from last night](https://social.lol/@adam/113059305119057100) criticizing 500.lol has been bothering me more than I can account for. The entire thing just pisses me off, and I need to back away while I try to understand why.

I suspect part of it is that I'm wrong about something and I don't want to admit it to myself. That pisses me off even more :). Anyway, a break will do me good.
