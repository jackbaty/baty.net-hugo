I was partially successful at avoiding social media yesterday. Whenever there was a lull in my thoughts, I'd "Just check for mentions real quick." This would be fine, but then I'd jump over to the feed and do a quick scroll through. That's the part I'm supposed to be off. Trying again today, but it's hard to resist.

Org-mode may be the Betamax of text formats, but if you recall, Beta was the _better_ format. VHS won, but not because it was better. Why would I use a lesser format for my notes than Org-mode? "Everyone uses Markdown" is not an answer.

We walked the channel in Grand Haven, today. A large boat cruised by sporting a giant Trump flag. That itself wasn't unusual, but the boat's name was "Insurrection". It made me want to do violence.
