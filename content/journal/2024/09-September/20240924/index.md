There's nothing on my schedule today and that is totally fine with me. It's not just fine, it's _preferred_.

I made some small (5"x7") prints in the darkroom this morning. I sometimes feel that the small prints aren't "worth it", but they're cheap and easy to make, so I keep doing it. I guess at the exposure and only reprint if I'm _way_ off. Otherwise, as my dad says, "Good enough for who it's for". And I'm always happy I have them later.
