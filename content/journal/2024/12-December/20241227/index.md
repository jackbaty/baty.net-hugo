I was working on a little shell script for generating GoAccess reports on the web server but I was running into a minor problem that I couldn't figure out. I asked ChatGPT for help and immediately had the solution, and a better overall script than I had written. The side effects of LLMs suck, but there's no denying their utility right now. I feel dirty, but I have a nice script, I guess?
