[Thanks Frank](https://frankmeeuwsen.com/2024/12/14/just-a-small.html)! It's good to know I'm not alone.

I went to sleep last night having decided that, "Tomorrow, I'm going to revamp my Emacs config and go back to my home-grown config." This morning, I thought, "Life would be easier if I just used Obsidian instead." So yeah, normal day so far 👋🏻.
