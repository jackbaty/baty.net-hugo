I know y'all are sick of me waffling about where to post these little daily notes, but I can't help it. I'm honestly split right down the middle about it. I want everything to be in one place, but I can't seem to make it all fit in one place. At least not the way I want things to fit. I could leave baty.net for the longer posts and daily.baty.net for these daily notes. Or, I could try combining everything here. Or maybe combine everything there and make this a landing page. I think each of these options has equal merit, so I haven't been able to decide, and probably never will. I guess I'll continue posting wherever I'm in the mood to post on any given day.

Today, I'm in the mood to do it on [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net).
