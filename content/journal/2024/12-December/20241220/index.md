[jAlbum](https://jalbum.net) is pretty good at creating nice static web photo galleries. I made an elaborate gallery last year. It was nice, but now I can't find my copy (or settings, originals, etc.) I'm not mad because I have to start over. I'm mad because all I do is organize stuff and despite that, I still can't find things. Probably _because_ of that, honestly. Anyway, starting over.

I need some new sources. Everything I read is related to AI or social media or some gadget I simply must buy. I'm bored with all of it.
