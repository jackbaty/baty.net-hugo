See, the thing is, I need to somehow keep the the "Reduce & Simplify" dream alive. It's OK if my system takes a little work to maintain, but it has to be _one_ system. I can manage one. What I can't do, is have a bunch of completely different setups that each take "a little work" to maintain. I've become overwhelmed as a result of my never-ending urge to tinker (combined with boredom). So here we are, on baty.net, doing daily notes again. One Blog, One Life or some such thing, right?

Speaking of limiting my systems, I just paid for an entire year of Adobe Photography 1TB plan (~$250). That committment requires that I don't renew my Capture One subscription, which is about the same cost, but C1 doesn't include Photoshop, LrC, Bridge, and 1TB of cloud storage. Seems like a no-brainer, but I still find it difficult to decide. Lightroom it is, I guess.

I'd rather have Reddit posts slurped up by AI than hit a bunch of [deleted] dead-ends when I'm trying to find the answer to something just because someone left in a huff.
