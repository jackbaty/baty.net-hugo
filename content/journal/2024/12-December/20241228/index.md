I don't feel like writing full-on blog posts, lately. What I'm interested in is journaling...in public. I don't like this Hugo template for that purpose, but I have learned that changing Hugo templates isn't worth the trouble. Now what?

After spending hours trying to find a decent alternative to Photo Mechanic, I ran across this post, by me, from June [Photo Mechanic in 2024 | Baty.net](/posts/2024/06/photo-mechanic-in-2024/), in which I describe how I ended up paying for a year subscription then. I'm very confused, because I don't remember doing that. At least I have 6 more months with PM, right?
