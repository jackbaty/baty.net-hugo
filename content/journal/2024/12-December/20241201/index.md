Oh dear. It's OK, though. What happened was that I started to feel twitchy about having my posts and photos locked up in Ghost. "Locked up" is an exaggeration, of course, but you know what I mean. It's better when everything is in a nice, tidy set of folders on my hard drive, in Org or Markdown format. So here we are, back in Hugo.

I've noticed a drop-off in interaction on Mastodon the past week or two. Is it because people are leaving? Maybe they just don't find me interesting anymore.
