Wouldn't it be great if, instead, we just stopped wanting more stuff?

I am almost embarrassed to admit that Adobe Bridge has become my default for dealing with photos. After dismissing it for years, it might now be my favorite "new" app. Weird how that happens. It does so much more than I thought. 

----

I don't have the energy to go around looking for things to be mad at.

----

The only thing Obsidian has to offer over Emacs is convenience. That's not a good enough reason to use it.

----

JFK Jr. is a public health emergency

[Online following and Starter Packs · Luna’s Blog](https://moonbase.lgbt/blog/online-following-starter-packs/)
> I want people to follow me naturally because they enjoy my posts in particular, I don’t want a tech/demoscene/gamedev/etc audience showing up in bulk just because someone else decided to put me on a list without my prior consent.

Hold on a sec, do we want to make it easier to find interesting people to follow or not? I can't keep up.

I can understand why it's worth the conversation, but this sits wrong with me. I can't help but read it as, "Sure, we want to make it easier to find people to follow, but leave me out of it. Those people haven't earned the right to follow me. And take me off your blogroll while we're at it."
