I'm looking at the contents of the media drive on my 2014 Mac Mini and there are dozens of seasons of TV shows in the Plex folder. I don't rewatch shows. Ok, I rewatched The Wire and West Wing but that's about it. I'm planning to decomission the Mini so I'm deciding what I need to keep. I don't need to keep the TV shows. That's a start.

I spent most of the day rejiggering my backups and other parts of my setup. It's December and I have not yet [Reduced nor Simplified](https://baty.net/journal/2023/12/31/reduce-and-simplify/). I pulled everything off the Mac Mini (2014) server. Consolidated all of my "Attic" folders. Moved backups into one spot. Rebuilt the Roon Core on the original NUC server, where it belongs. Things were getting out of hand, and it felt good to reel it in just a little.
