I'm in the middle of re-reading "Digital Minimalism" by Cal Newport and I must've put the book down to check my phone at least a dozen times last night. I'm doing it wrong.

The best way to avoid having to organize things is to not have things to begin with. I'm deleting so much stuff right now. I'm going to regret it, but I _need_ this. It's self care :)
