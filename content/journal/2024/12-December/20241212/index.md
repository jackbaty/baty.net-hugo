On daily.baty.net, each little whim of a post has its own page and is part of the RSS feed (and gets cross-posted to my [mastodon.social bot account](https://mastodon.social/@batybot)). Some days, that's exactly what I want. When I write daily notes here at baty.net, using the single-entry-per-day format, I feel less pressure to make anything "count". And some days, _that's_ exactly what I want. Living in my head is frustrating.
