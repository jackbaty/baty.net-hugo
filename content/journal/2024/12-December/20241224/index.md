I was going through my Braintoss messages and this one from April, 2023 jumped out at me:

> there's a low-level specific pain in having to accept that putting up with you
> requires a certain generosity of spirit in your loved ones

Ouch ðŸ˜¬ (It's from â€• Emily St. John Mandel, Sea of Tranquility)

Also this one:

> The thing I miss most about working is canceled meetings.

And this:

> you know I think I want to read a book about minimalism as a concept but really
> I just want somebody to tell me how to organize my closet
