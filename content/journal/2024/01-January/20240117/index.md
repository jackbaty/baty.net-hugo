I swear some days I want to single-handedly bring back single-use devices.

Remember when I used [wttr](http://wttr.in) to show the weather like this?

```
   _`/"".-.     Light snow
    ,\_(   ).   8(-7) °F
     /(___(__)  ↗ 14 mph
       *  *  *  3 mi
      *  *  *   0.0 in
```

Historically, the day after getting a COVID booster, I would feel pretty crappy. So far this morning I'm only suffering from a sore arm. This one was from Pfizer rather than Moderna, so we'll see.

I waffle between wanting a boring, simple, clean blog and one that's fun and wild and odd and playful. My heart says the latter but my head says the former. Head wins for now, I guess.

Could I have a [Denote](https://github.com/protesilaos/denote) plugin for [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) please? I don't even know it should do, but I want one.
