I'm sitting here at my Fedora desktop thinking about how I spent hours yesterday learning about and setting up Chezmoi for managing my dotfiles. Just a week ago I posted something on Mastodon to the effect of, "I think I lost the thread the minute I started worrying about managing my dotfiles." I started wondering if maybe maybe the all-in-with-Linux thing wasn't such a great idea. It's fun, but it has consumed so much of my time that I'm wondering if it's worth it. I kind of want to stop thinking about it. I'm charging the MacBook Air as I type this. You don't want to be in my head. It's chaos in there.

And now I'm typing on the Mac Mini at my desk. I need a break from trying to make everything I want to do on a computer do it the way I want it to on Linux. I think where I'll end up is macOS on desktop and Linux on the Framework. The laptop will be more of a satellite device and not one that I need to do _everything_ on. Just writing and browsing, mostly.
