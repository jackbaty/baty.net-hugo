- **STATUS**: All-in with Linux I guess
- **TODO**: Nothing planned today
- **WATCHING**: Caught up on Fallout

</div>

I'm considering bringing back the [/notes](/notes) section of the blog. For a minute I planned to modify the template so that /notes didn't display or require titles. Thing is, I don't want to go down the customize-my-blog-all-day path right now. I'm busy enough with the move to Linux. Maybe later.
