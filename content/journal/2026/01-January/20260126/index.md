Most of the time when I try new things, It's to see how those things feel. Software, hardware, cameras, workflow, all of it. I love experiencing new ways of doing things. Sometimes I end up "deciding" on a particular thing, and that's that. Except it _never_ is, is it?

What I'd like is to show the current journal post, pinned on the home page. It should display the full content of the post. Then, below that, only show recent non-journal posts. I'm sure Hugo will resist and I'll end up hating the process and the results. I'd ask Claude for help, but that's a whole 'nuther can of worms and I'm not in the mood.

I'd like to spend my days reading, thinking, and making art but I can't tear myself away from the computer for more than 30 minutes, so I do none of those things. The computer used to be a creative environment for me. It's not anymore.

Do you ever get tired of people writing better than you, drawing better than you, thinking better than you, _being_ better than you? I do.
