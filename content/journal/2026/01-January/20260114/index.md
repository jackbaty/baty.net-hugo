I hit a computing wall yesterday. Suddenly, I stopped caring about any of it. I'd just as soon live in the woods than think about how to manage my dotfiles (again). Or sync, or window managers. In fact, I don't want to think about the computer at all. I just want to _use_ it. For some reason all I do is think about it. I'm back on macOS again on my desktop and thinking about just ditching Linux for now. It's so cool, though! Maybe when I start wanting to think about the computer again. This mood probably won't last, but for now, I'm going to go out and take some pictures.
