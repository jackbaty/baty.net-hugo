~~Journal (Daily) posts don't show up on the home page, currently~~. I can't decide if that's a good or bad thing. On one hand, I don't need to worry about journal posts cluttering up the "important" stuff. Except then they disappear into the void, so I may decide to include them after all.

The other bit of trouble I ran into was the default RSS feed in the Blowfish theme. Hugo's default rss template is lacking. It only sends the summary and doesn't include any featured images. You'd think all theme developers by now would have dealt with that. I've done it myself a half-dozen times, but nope. I had to build one. It now includes the full content of each post, and the featured image, if available. The next thing is to include the Reply By Email button
