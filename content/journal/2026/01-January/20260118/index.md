I'm sure you are tired of hearing about my non-stop waffling around software, operating systems, workflows, etc., and in that case, I apologize in advance.

After putting the Macs in the closet and committing to Linux, I went 180° and have been on Linux exclusively again for a few days. I'm finding I prefer _being_ in KDE than Tahoe. A week ago I wrote [How I feel when using Linux](https://linux.baty.net/2026/01/how-i-feel-when-using-linux/) and that became even more true as I later used macOS. I need to decide if I can live without the apps that I thought I couldn't live without. Still working on that.
