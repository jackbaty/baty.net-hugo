Are you sick of me talking about Linux, yet? I am. But this is such a big change in my entire computing world that it's hard not talking about it. I'm running Fedora/KDE on my desktop and have had few issues. Yesterday, I scanned another roll of film using Vuescan and editing them in Darktable. I didn't hate it, which is an improvement. The only way to judge something is to use it for a while. Familiarity breeds contentment. Or something :).

By the way, I posted something related to this on the linux blog: [How I feel when using Linux](https://linux.baty.net/2026/01/how-i-feel-when-using-linux/)

It's so easy to be kind to people. Why do so many people find it difficult?
