I've been secretly conducting an experiment called "Use Obsidian Exclusively for 30 Days". It started a week ago. I'm typing this in Emacs, in case you're wondering how it's going.

Dante Stella on over-thinking travel photography:

> It is difficult for amateur photographers to accept that, on any given
> trip, they will not likely take unique photos of staggering social
> significance or prize-winning landscapitude. The reality is that the
> photos most likely to survive generationally will be the ones with
> family members in them. The rest stand a good chance of being binned.
