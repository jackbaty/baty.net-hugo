It seems like this is turning into an Emacs blog. Not that there's anything wrong with that :).

It's getting harder and harder to discover useful videos on YouTube. Every thumbnail is created using the same "Make a crazy face and point at something!" format. Every title is a despirate grab for attention. The recommendation algorithm is all over the map and usually not helpful. I rely on subscriptions to known quantities and recommendations from other _people_. I wish it was better.
