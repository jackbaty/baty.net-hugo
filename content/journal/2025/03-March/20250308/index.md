It seems like this is turning into an Emacs blog. <br>
Not that there's anything wrong with that :).

It's getting harder and harder to discover useful videos on YouTube. Every thumbnail is created using the same "Make a crazy face and point at something!" format. Every title is a despirate grab for attention. The recommendation algorithm is all over the map and usually not helpful. I rely on subscriptions to known quantities and recommendations from other _people_. I wish it was better.

I've been meaning to do something similar, but haven't gotten around to it. I'd probably not be so fancy. I also like the `<cite>` block in quotes, as seen above. That would be even more involved. Right now I have a bookmarklet that copies a Markdown-formatted version and I tweak it by hand as needed.

I'm thinking about migrating all of the content from [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org) into individual text (.md or .org) files and freezing the wiki. I love the thing, but I would like to focus my attention on Emacs/Org/etc. right now.
