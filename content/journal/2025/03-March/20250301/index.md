I packed up the Leica SL2 and took some photos of it yesterday. It's ready to be sold. Except that it felt so good to handle the camera that I put the lens back on,  stuck a card in, and took it with me to dinner last night. Even though I never took it out of the bag, it's such a nice camera that I don't know if I want to give it up. This is a problem, because I can't (or at least shouldn't) keep both the Leica and the Nikon. Selling the Nikon just a couple weeks after buying it new would be a terrible financial decision. Of course, when have I ever made the right financial decision when it came to photography?

I would love to be a person who goes out to photograph because I have something to say, rather than someone looking for an excuse to play with cameras and because I'm bored.

I find YouTube to be 95% useless, but the other 5% is helpful and can be absolutely amazing and wonderful.
