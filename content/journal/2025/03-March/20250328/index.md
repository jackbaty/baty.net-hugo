I spent hours this morning trying to find a good way of adding some metadata to the cover images on the blog. I wanted the temparature, at least. I tried shoehorning it into my [Retrobatch](https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/) script, but that was a dead end. Whenever I'm lost in image manipulation, I turn to [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org). Boy did that take me down a rabbit hole. Long story short, [I figured it out](/posts/2025/03/annotating-an-image-with-weather/). But now I don't like it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
