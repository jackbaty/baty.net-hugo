I went to bed last night exhausted by overthinking everything I do. Correction, what's exhausting is overthinking the minutiae and underthinking the important stuff. Things that are mostly solved problems with proper, simple solutions: email, RSS reading, blogging, taking notes, etc. I spend an inordinate amount of time playing with things when I should be using them to, you know, _do things_.
