Walking Alice this morning shortly after 3:30 AM, I thought the moon looked weird. There was only the slightest sliver lit and the rest was a deep red. Turns out there was a total lunar eclipse at 3:30. That explained it.

I spun up a WordPress blog this morning because I was bored and wanted to tinker with something. It's so easy to get started, but the block and site editors still feel like a janky, confusing mess. Just make me a nice theme with a few options and access to CSS and I'm good. I deleted the site 20 minutes later. Guess I'll need to find something else to play with today.
