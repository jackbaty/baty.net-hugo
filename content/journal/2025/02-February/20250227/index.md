I've been shopping for desktop computers to run Linux. Something easy and nice, like a low-mid range Thelios, maybe. This is a terrible idea and I should stop doing it at once.

When do you think I'll finally find something that I'm good at?

There are too many people in my head.

I like Matt Birchler's [Quick Reviews](https://quickreviews.app/) app, but I wish it would look up the year/director for me. The new iOS app might do something like that, but I won't use the app on iOS.

Some days I find myself in a foul mood because "Emacs is being stupid and annoying and I don't feel like dealing with it!"

Today, though, Emacs has been making me absolutely giddy. It can be wonderful, and I wish more people could put in the time to get to know (and love) it. üòç.
