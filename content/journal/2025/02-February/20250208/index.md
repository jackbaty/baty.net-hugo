I have an idea about these daily posts. I'll be writing throughout the day over in [the wiki](https://wiki.baty.net). Then, end of day, I'll grab anything I think is worth sharing and re-post it here. I mean, I didn't call the wiki a "Rudimentary Lathe" for nothing.

Merlin mentions how much he loves spreadsheets in [The historical cost of dancing medicine](https://merlin.ghost.io/dancing-medicine/). It reminded me of how much I **dislike** spreadsheets. Always have, for some reason. Give me an outline or a database instead.
