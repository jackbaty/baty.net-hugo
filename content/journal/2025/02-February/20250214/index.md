Still a bit sick. Slept better, though. It's hard using a CPAP with a stuffy nose.

I'm in one of those moods where I don't feel like managing anything. It occurred to me that Emacs helps with this. Denote and Org Journal both manage the files for me. I just type. Org-attach handles my files for me. On the other hand, TiddlyWiki is Just One File, so there's that.

The thing I'm thinking about now is going back to Lightroom desktop for photos. I've been using Lightroom Classic because it's got _everything_, but it sure is janky compared to the new Lightroom. And with Ligthtroom I don't need to organize everything (although I probably would, anyway). Still thinking about it.
