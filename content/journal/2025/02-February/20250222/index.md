I still don't know what belongs here. It's mostly just a place to write things I'm thinking about. Things that have even the remotest chance of being useful or entertaining to someone else. There are _at least_ three places I write things: Here, [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org), and my Emacs daybook. And this doesn't include the paper options. I don't enjoy having to decide where to put things, but I have been unsuccessful in limiting myself to only one option.
