I've removed these journal posts from the RSS feed for now. I like the feeling of writing without worrying about dumping all this crap into a bunch of unsuspecting RSS readers. Who knows, I may end up staying with [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org) for this. What will likely end up happening is that I'll keep doing both, depending on my mood that day.

I don't feel like exercising or weighing myself today. I guess I'm not in the mood for expending any effort or being exposed to any more bad news right now.
