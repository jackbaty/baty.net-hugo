[What's New in Emacs 30.1? - Mastering Emacs](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/whats-new-in-emacs-301)

> Full support for Emacs on Android, and a whole host of touch screen-related improvements to Emacs as a result.

Most of today was spent farting around in Emacs. Again. I don't mind. It was fun. I tweaked Howm. Played with Gnus. Upgraded to Emacs 30.1, and cleaned up some config. A good time was had by all.
