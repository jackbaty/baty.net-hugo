I made a little [Retrobatch](https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/) script to overlay the date onto a photo. It's meant for the OpenGraph cover image on these daily posts. I don't normally include the photo in the posts themselves, but I did today. For some reason.

Still doing journal posts both here and in [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org), seemingly at random. I should figure this out. It's just that I sometimes like doing it one way, and sometimes the other way.
