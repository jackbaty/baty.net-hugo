Woke up tired of everything. Not a great start to the day. I wrote yesterday that "my blog is fine", and I still feel that way this morning. It's blogging that I'm tired of. Or maybe it's that I'm tired of thinking about blogs and blogging. Of course, I'm writing about this _on my blog_ so none of it makes sense. Still, I'd like something different. By "different" I don't mean some other blogging platform. I'm not sure what I mean, honestly.
