Now that I've added a [/notes](/notes) section to the blog, where does that leave these daily notes? I think I'll keep them. It gives me a place to record some notes throughout the day, but without spewing everything out to social media seventeen times. Just the once :). Then again, isn't that what [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org) is for?
