I've been going through my Lightroom library and noticed a couple things. First, I used to just walk around with a camera and take pictures of things. Some of them are pretty good. Second, my Lightroom catalog has _everything_ and I'm wondering if abandoning it was a good idea.

My mates at lunch today are all in with AI. One works at a startup, the other for a large manufacturer. Both manage development and product teams. Both claim to be "10 times more productive since using AI." One said, "I get things done now that I'd never even attempted before AI."

A counterpoint to all the "AI is useless and stupid!" discourse out there, I guess.
