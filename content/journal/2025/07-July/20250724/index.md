Too hot for chores, today, so I'm in my air-conditioned office, futzing with AI tools, server options, and my Emacs capture templates.

For some reason, I can't get a markdown-mode-hook to fire and call olivetti-mode when I open a Markdown file in an Emacs buffer. I'm using the exact method that works with org-mode files. It's a small annoyance, but this is why I sometimes want to quit.
