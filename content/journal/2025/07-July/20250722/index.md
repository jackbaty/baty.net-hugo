Ozzy died today. For a long time, I expected this to happen any minute. He didn't exactly live a healthy lifestyle. After a certain point, though, it seemed like he might live forever. His "Blizzard of Ozz" tour in 1981 was one of the of the first concerts I saw. I remember leaning my head into a speaker cone, because LOUDER!
