Why bother blogging when _even I don't feel like reading my posts_?

----

I guess I don't understand why blurring my "content" behind semi-transparent UI controls is any better than hiding it behind easily-distinguished UI controls. The content itself is unusable either way, so why not make the controls easier to see/use?

----

What do we think about about the whole [/notes](/notes) implementation here? I don't think I like it. I don't feel like creating a whole thing every time I want to share whatever useless thought pops into my head. OTOH, I don't much like putting everything into these daily posts, either. Not on this blog, in this format, anyway. On the other hand, why not just do it here? Problem is already solved, right?

----

Can you tell there's something going on with me? I don't feel like thinking about all the details and options with _everything_ I do. Is it possible to _underthink_ thinks? Because that's what I'd like to do for a while.

----

"I've decided to use Emacs for my notes" doesn't really narrow my options all that much, since Emacs is a self-contained infinity of choices all by itself.
