Can you imagine much easier things would be if I...

- Used (only one) digital camera
- Put my photos in one big Lightroom Classic catalog
- Or maybe just used my iPhone with Apple Photos

I saw a post where someone complained that the timeline for some community was "...a sanitized version of reality." My question is, must every "community" always, no matter what, include content from every possible awful corner of the universe? If I wanted "reality", I'd go read about it. I _know_ shit is terrible, that's why I'm hanging out in this nice space for a spell...as a respite.  Is it not OK to want to be mildly entertained and amused for a little while? I mean, we don't bitch about, say, The Disney Channel existing, do we? I don't believe people have the right to demand that every space conform to every situation.

I turn 61 years old, today. That seems like a lot.
