Firing up a new daily note every morning used to be a regular thing for me. Lately, it just gives me blank page anxiety. It's possible that an "I don't feel much like blogging" phase is starting. I know this because I don't feel much like blogging.

I have a doctor's appointment today. Just a scheduled follow-up, but there's a lot of pre-appointment guilt happening. My blood pressure is a little higher than we'd like, so in our last meeting I suggested that instead of upping my meds, that I eat healthier and exercise more. I've done neither of those, so my BP will still be too high and he'll have to tsk-tsk me and prescribe something stronger. I hate having to take medications, but it's my own damn fault.
