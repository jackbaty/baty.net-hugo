It's been a minute since I've added one of these daily notes. I thought I was done with them, but here we are. The reason might not make much sense to many. Linux, or at least the one I'm using, doesn't have Emacs bindings everywhere, the way macOS does. I've been slow to get used to it. I may never get used to it. In the meantime, the one place that _does_ have Emacs bindings is Emacs, so that's where I'm spending as much time as possible. The blog is Hugo and I've got a whole Emacs setup for publishing here. For now, that's what I'm doing.
