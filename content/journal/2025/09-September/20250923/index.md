The new Framework 13 is pretty much ready for action. I'm still dealing with how and what to sync between machines. I've rejiggered my emacs config so that it's all done via Git. More work than expected. The rest of the system is even more confusing. I'm not going to sync all of .config/ but seems like _most_ of it could be. And what parts of Omarchy make sense to sync? I'm new here.

Once or twice a week lately I have an ocular migraine that wipes out parts of my vision for 20-30 minutes. I use that time to go for a walk.
