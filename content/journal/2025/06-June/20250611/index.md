Daily notes. What are they for? I guess it's like having a legal pad open on my desk, where I can write whatever I'm thinking about at any time. The problem for you, dear reader, is that you're subjected to all of it. I feel a little guilty about that. Not guilty enough to stop doing it, of course.
