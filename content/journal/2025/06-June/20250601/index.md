There are things I want to talk about, but I don't feel like writing any of it.

You see, _that's_ what LLMs are good for. They may not be smart enough to write production-level, professional code, but goddamn if they're not great for helping normal people whip up things that would have been next to impossible for them just a year ago. I do it all the time.

LLMs today are like desktop publishing software in the late 1980s. Using Claude feels like when I first got hold of an Apple LaserWriter and PageMaker. Suddenly, I could _make_ things, all by myself. Didn't matter whether I was "qualified" or not.
