While visiting my grandson this morning, I finished a roll of expired Portra 400 in the Rolleiflex. When I got home, I didn't feel like developing the roll. C-41 processing is a whole thing. It's not hard, but I don't love it. Still, I'm usually excited to at least see what's on the roll. Today, I wasn't. Not a great sign.
