If there are "Notes" listed under this post, it means the thing I've been working on here is...working, I guess.

(Update, they're missing from the RSS feed. I'll work on that later.)

I dunno, seems to me that if it's working, it's working, but I suppose that's his point. Even though I agree with a lot of the article, it's the kind of thing someone writes when they _really really_ don't wan't something to be true. I swear I'm going to stop commenting on all this nonsense and go back to the super-cool homeopathic software I co-wrote (aka "vibe-coded") today. You know, the one that's working. I don't need to prove anything to you.
