I haven't been mentioning Omarchy or the Framework laptop lately because I don't feel like being scolded for "supporting projects that promote facism" which is of course not what they're doing, but whatever. I'm not interested in arguing about it, and I'm not going to clear my throat before every mention. fwiw I like both products very much. Send me an actual apples-to-apples equivalent and I might switch.
