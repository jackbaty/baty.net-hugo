It’s weird how I spend a few days relaxing in WordPress, then I wake up one day and think, “Maybe I’ll generate my whole website with Org-mode and Emacs!” I probably won’t do that, but I sometimes consider it.

I don’t want photography be just another way to generate files to play with on the computer.

The temperature dipped to freezing for the first time this year. This usually means it's truly the end of summer. Blech.

<div class="compact status">

- **STATUS**: An entire day to myself with no other obligations. ::rubs hands together and laughs maniacally::
- **TODO**: I’ll probably fart around more in Darktable. Maybe even hit the darkroom to make a few prints.
- **LISTENING**: Talking Heads greatest hits (on CD)

</div>
