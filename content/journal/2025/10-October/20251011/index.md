I'm still finding things that I'd changed in my PaperMod fork that I kind of need now that I've switched to the stock version. The Reply-By-Email button, for one. My improvement to image rendering from yesterday doesn't work in the RSS feed because it uses a relative URL for the image. I had fixed this in my fork, so I copied that over. I also tried adding the reply button there, also.

Here's an image to test the RSS version of the link:
