Me, on this day in 2019:

> For like a week now I've gone to bed with the ThinkPad and using Linux to actually do stuff. It's fun. Not easy or care-free, but for the first time I'm having a little fun.

The [3.1.0 update](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/releases/tag/v3.1.0) to [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) has been released. The Discord channels are awash with people having trouble with the update, but I ran it on both my machines anyway. No issues so far.
