I don't know where to put things. I have several dozen files in my Downloads folder and I've no idea what to do with them.

It's possible I've bitten off more than I can chew. New desktop and laptop. New OS on both. New NAS. New media streamer (Jellyfin rather than Plex). New Immich install (via Docker on the UGREEN NAS). New photo editing software (Darktable). It's a little overwhelming. My M4 Air is taunting me from the shelf over there.
