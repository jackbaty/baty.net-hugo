I'm still working on my photo workflow in Linux. It's gotten to the point of being tolerable, but it's still not _enjoyable_.  Darktable is powerful but there are too many ways of doing everything. I feel like I'm just throwing stuff at the wall, hoping it turns out. I suppose I will eventually find a process that works consistently, but right now I'm not even close to that. I really miss Capture One.

I've spent a ton of time and money moving my film scanning workflow from a flatbed to using a digital camera. My results using Darktable's Negadoctor module have been lackluster, so I re-scanned my last roll using the Epson flatbed. I still feel like it's faster and less fussy doing it that way. I loaded the TIFF scans in Capture One, selected all of them, and hit "Auto" and that was it. They look better than the ones I futzed with forever in Darktable. I haven't timed it, but I'd bet that the total time from dried film to shareable images is significantly faster using the flatbed. Sigh.
