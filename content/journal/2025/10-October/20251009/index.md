Aaaaand, we're back.

Sometimes I really like WordPress. It lasts a week or two.

I cleaned a few things up around here. The big one is that I'm now using the stock PaperMod theme rather than the mess I made in my own fork. I'll probably tweak, but I don't want to maintain my own theme.

I also removed /notes from the navigation. I don't need them. I may find some other way to indicate/present shorter posts, but for now it's all either a post or a daily note.

Who knows if I'll end up back there. Some of the cool upcoming ActivityPub stuff might draw me. For now, though, it's Hugo at Baty.net.

The idea that "...endorsing ANYTHING is 100% endorsing that anything's beliefs." is horseshit, btw.
