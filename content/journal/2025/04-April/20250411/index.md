Dammit, now I'm posting journal posts in [two places](https://copingmechanism.com/11apr25/). I get bored doing things the same way every day, so I change things. I don't know if this makes me interesting or if it's a symptom of some deep-rooted mental issue.

Read Mike's [Deft, Markdown, Marksman/Emacs LSP, iA Writer](https://mph.puddingtime.org/post/deft-markdown-marksman-emacs-lsp-ia-writer) and then spent an hour playing with Marksman and I ended up getting nowhere and now I'm upset that I can't get wikilink completion in random Markdown files. This is why I shouldn't be using Emacs.

You know how I say that I'd rather not think about my blogging software and just concentrate on writing instead? And you know how sometimes I try to do that by _changing my platform and workflow_? Yeah, I sometimes miss the irony of doing that. There's almost nothing in my existing workflow that needs changing, if I'm honest. If I wanted to, I could "not think about blogging software and just write." So why don't I, then?
