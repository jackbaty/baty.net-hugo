I should apologize for [my mood this morning](/posts/2025/04/i-dont-care-what-you-think/)...Sorry about my mood this morning.

Yesterday, I decided to bring back my Doom Emacs config. I've been missing evil-mode and using Space as leader key. Sometimes hitting Control-this Control-that constantly becomes tedious, ya know? After a couple of hours, I bailed on the idea. Doom offers a ton of quality-of-life features, but it also contains a lot of magic. As much as I appreciate the magic, I too often feel like it's working against me. Back to my own config, which works against me too, but at least it's my fault this way.
