Linux is fun, but frustrating. I'm trying to stick with it long enough to blame Linux rather than my inexperience for my troubles. As a way to help remember the process, I've started a new blog at [linux.baty.net](https://linux.baty.net)[^1]. The new blog is a journal of things I'm learning or struggling with. I'd normally be taking these notes locally but I thought it would be worthwhile to publish them.



[^1]: I must admit that this was also a fun excuse to play with [BSSG](https://bssg.dragas.net/).
