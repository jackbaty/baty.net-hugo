Yeah, I've been distracted by a couple of new static blogging tools. I think both are interesting and worth a serious look by anyone looking for simple, local-first, Markdown-based blogging. I'll try to write a bit more detail about them, but for now, check them out yourself. [BSSG](https://bssg.dragas.net/) is a complete static site generator written in Bash. The only dependency is a markdown processor. Cmark is recommended and simple. I use Pandoc. It's simple, fast enough, and has a refreshingly easy to use theming system with a ton of built-in themes. Then there's [LMNO.lol](https://lmno.lol), which is even easier. Create a single Markdown file with all your posts, then just drag and drop the file into lmno.lol and boom! you have a blog. This one is a hosted service. Check them out! I did: [linux.baty.net](https://linux.baty.net) and [baty.blog](https://baty.blog) are BSSG blogs and [lmno.lol/jbaty](https://lmno.lol/jbaty) is at lmno.lol.
