I need to find a way for my brain to relax. I spend entire days with a dozen apps open, each with a dozen tabs open. I click rapidly between them looking for something to focus on. I never find anything.

Part of my problem might be that I've surrounded myself with too much infrastructure. There are dependencies everywhere. [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net/) for example. The idea is that I have a separate blog that works well for short, daily writing. Except that now I have two blogs. And I'm (for the moment) using Kirby for that one. This means an entirely different workflow and setup. This is great for when I'm feeling bored with Hugo. It keeps me from moving this blog back and forth. However, it's also more stuff in my brain. Do I need more stuff in my brain? Right now, I don't think so. Hence, I'm writing today's journal post here.
