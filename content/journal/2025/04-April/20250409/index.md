I'm supposed to be working on a new website for a family member. I'm 80% finished, but the final 80% is the uninteresting part and I don't feel like doing it right now. Instead, I spent an hour this morning feeling like I should go back to using Lightroom Classic instead of Capture One, but I still prefer Capture One, so I'll have to deal with the things I don't like about it.
