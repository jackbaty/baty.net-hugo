I'm rarely in a hurry, so why do I spend so much time working on ways to do things faster? Working on the Linux laptop this week has made so many things slower. I don't have a text expansion utility configured yet. I don't have something like Raycast on the Mac. Still, I don't feel like I'm doing less. In fact, my mind has been calmer. Writing on the ThinkPad feels more like using a typewriter. OK, that's an exaggeration, but you see the point. There's much less going on, here. I have the usual urge to "improve" things, but I may just wait a minute on that and see if I can settle in with something simpler.
