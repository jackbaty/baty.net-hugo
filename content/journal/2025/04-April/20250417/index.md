I've been busy with my [Linux experiment](https://linux.baty.net). I'm writing about it there, if you want to follow along.

Today, I put a [Framework laptop](https://frame.work/products/laptop13-diy-amd-ai300/configuration/new) in my cart. This whole experiment only got rolling because I thought I might like Linux on my _desktop_, so why am I looking at laptops when I have a perfectly servicable (2015) ThinkPad X1 Carbon (that I'm typing on right now)? I can't explain it. Most likely it's because I have an Apple Studio Display and (I'm told) it's quite challenging to use it with Linux. I'm not changing monitors for this, the Studio Display is too good (and expensive).
