I hope everyone had a relaxing weekend. I did, at least up until I tried setting up a new(ish) iPhone for my mom. She got a hand-me-down iPhone 12 to replace her, surprisingly still working, iPhone 6. Between Find My/anti-theft issues and forgotten passwords, it was much more frustrating than I'd hoped. Still, she has a new phone and that's good.

Today, I want to be the guy who only has a paper notebook, a beat up Linux laptop, and a film camera...and is happy with it.
