I posted the same thing on three different blogs today, just for fun.

1. [here on baty.net](https://baty.net/posts/2025/04/consolidating-my-email-handling-in-emacs/)
2. [on lmno.lol](https://lmno.lol/jbaty/consolidating-my-email-handling-in-emacs)
3. [on baty.blog (BSSG)](https://baty.blog/2025/04/consolidating-my-email-handling-in-emacs/)

All three of them were fun to do, which is why I keep so many blogs going at once.
