I had fun yesterday working with the [Coping Mechanism](https://copingmechanism.com) blog and Ghost. If you ignore the upsell and "please subscribe!" noise, Ghost is rather pleasant to work with. The problem is that I don't want to migrate this blog to it, and I don't want multiple blogs. This means that, while I still may tinker with Ghost, I shouldn't use it for anything "real". So, what am I doing? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

I'm typing this in [iA Writer](https://www.ia.net/writer) for reasons I can't explain.
