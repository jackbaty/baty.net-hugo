I am off social media for a bit. Whenever I feel myself doing nothing but scrolling or looking for likes or thinking of something "like-able" to say, I know it's time for a break. I'm not cross-posting to Mastodon at all anymore, either. So now, whenever there's a lull in the action of my life, I feel lost. That's the feeling I want to get rid of.
