I got up today and discovered my Mac Mini server backups (via Backblaze) haven't been running in more than a week. Claimed that there were permissions issues, but there shouldn't have been. Nothing has changed, but it stopped working. This is the kind of thing that makes me want to remove every dependency I can find. It makes me want to stop using things that have any reasonable chance of just not working one morning. It's exhausting, because that list includes nearly _everything_. Now, all it took to fix it was reinstalling the Backblaze client, but an easy solution doesn't make it more fun having to worry about the problem to begin with.

We're spending the day by the lakeshore, so at least I'll have a day off from "...but what if I did it this way, instead!?...", which will be nice.

I wrote this 3 years ago, today:

> It's just that sometimes I tire of staring at (mostly) monospaced text in Emacs. Sometimes I don't find it fun to have to figure out why some minor behavior isn't working the same as it was last week. Taking notes shouldn't be a technical challenge. I don't always want to `M-x` my way through life.

Everything comes around again.
