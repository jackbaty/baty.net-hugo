I see [Zed](https://zed.dev/) just received [$32 million from Sequoai](https://zed.dev/blog/sequoia-backs-zed) because "this investment lets us pursue our vision for bringing a new kind of collaboration directly into the IDE." Well, never mind, then. I want nothing to do with "collaborative editing", nor the inevitable decline of anything touched by VC money. Thank goodness there's [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/).

I'm running [immich](https://immich.app) on the Mac Mini via Docker and it's been working great. It's fast and simple to use. Hosting has (knock on wood) been a breeze so far, too. I like it.
