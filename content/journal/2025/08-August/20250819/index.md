Suddenly, two copies of the weather were showing on journal posts here. I have no idea how that happened. I've cobbled together a fix, but sheesh. This is another thing with Hugo...I don't get how most of it actually works. There's magic going on and I just piggyback off it with a lot of copy and paste and guesses. This is no way to run a website, is it?
