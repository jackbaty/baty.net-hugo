I'm considering removing the /notes section and just rolling everything into the main feed. Let's try "Everything is just a post" for a while. Sure, it'll be messy and too noisy for some, but it might help prevent the "is this a note or a post?" thing every time I start typing.

I'll be happy to talk to machines once I no longer need to learn their language in order to do so.
