During frequent bouts of Subscription Fatigue, I always glance sideways atÂ [SetApp](https://setapp.com/), thinking that I could cancel my subscription. Then I look at the apps I have installed via SetApp (see above) and once again realize that it might be the most useful $10/month subscription I have. So it stays.
