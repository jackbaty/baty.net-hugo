I use [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/) on Linux. While playing around with [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) (I know, I know) I learned about [Tridactyl](https://tridactyl.xyz/about/) which is a plugin that let's you manipulate Firefox (or Zen) using Vim-like key bindings.

It feels weird and I keep tripping over myself, but I feel like once I'm used to it, this is a great way to browse.
