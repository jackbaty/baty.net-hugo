I've decided to exclude any "Journal" posts here from the RSS feed. Thing is, I like how it feels to write stuff here knowing that it's not "going anywhere". If something shows up that is particularly brilliant, I'll create a separate post. Since most things are decidedly _not_ particularly brilliant, I'll feel better keeping it to myself (and the handful of ~~loonies~~ people who actually come and visit the website).

If there's an outcry, I'll put things back. Or maybe set up a separate feed just for the journal entries. I dunno.
