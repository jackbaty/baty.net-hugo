I'm over 60 now, so I often react differently to certain things than younger people do. Badly, most of the time.

Take, for example, the rise of "Video Podcasts". To me, that's always seemed a contradiction in terms. "Podcasts are audio!," I'd grumble. I don't know why I cared, because I _never_ listen to podcasts, anyway.

I do, however, watch a lot of YouTube. Like, a lot. Too much, but I'll deal with that later. Recently, I was watching a lengthy video about some topic or another, when I realized that the entire thing was just two people talking into microphones while a camera was running. Then it happened. One of the guys said something like, "You can follow this podcast here or on...". Dammit! They called it a podcast. Was I really _watching_ a podcast? Damn kids!

Lately, I've found myself watching YouTube videos via Apple TV. It's a nice way to kick back and browse things to watch. Better than going through random trailers on Netflix, I think.

One reason I don't listen to podcasts is that I can't process background audio while doing _anything_ else. It simply turns to noise, so unless I'm sitting quietly and just listening, podcasts are a waste of my time. And I struggle just sitting and listening.

On the other hand, _watching_ a podcast keeps me focused on the material, even if it's only a couple of talking heads. Interesting!

Anyway, it occurred to me that I am now a person who watches YouTube "podcasts" on the TV from the couch, and I don't know how I feel about that.
