My daughter has been sending me adorable AI-generated images of her and my grandson in various Christmas get-ups. They're so fun and cute and she's having a blast.

It makes me wonder, though, what happens 20 years from now when she's scrolling back through her photos and sees these. Will she remember that they're faked? How will she know what's real and what's not? How will my grandson?

I worry that it won't matter to her or anyone else that their pasts are imaginary. Well, it matters to me and it makes me sad.
