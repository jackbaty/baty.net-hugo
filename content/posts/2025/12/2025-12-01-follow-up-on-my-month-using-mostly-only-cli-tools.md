In November, I experimented with [using only CLI tools](https://baty.net/posts/2025/10/cli-and-tui-only-for-november/). How did it go?

I'd give it a 7 out of 10. 


The other two CLI-based productivity tools I used for the month were [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) and [nb](https://xwmx.github.io/nb/#home). Taskwarrior is very good at managing tasks, but I don't know if it'll stick as my main task app. There's too much typing involved with keeping things updated (adding tags, projects, etc.). The [TUI](https://github.com/kdheepak/taskwarrior-tui) helps, but I'm not sure it's enough. I'm currently tinkering with [Super Productivity](https://super-productivity.com/) as more GUI-ified option, but I'll probably just end up back in Emacs org-mode like I always do.

I'm still exploring `nb`. It's surprisingly deep and capable, and I'll miss it if I stop using it.

I don't know what I'll use `nb` _for_, exactly. It's not like I don't have too many places to keep stuff already. Still, it's neat and handy. The downside is that typing the entry ID gets tedious: e.g. `nb edit 157`. Another issue is that when there are thousands of files, listings can get pretty slow. For example, in my "kb" notebook, searches can take 10 seconds or longer to return all results. I'm enamoured of it, though, so I'm keeping it around for now.

For email, I'm still [using aerc](https://baty.net/posts/2025/10/using-aerc-for-email/) for quickly checking messages. I alternate between aerc and the Fastmail web UI. Both are fine, but I'm surprised by how much I miss Apple Mail on macOS.

The thing that puts me off sticking all CLI, all the time is that sometimes I just want to kick back and drive with the mouse for a while. Being forced to use a keyboard for _everything_ puts me off after a while. I'm happy to be wrapping up the experiment, but I'm hanging on to the CLI tools I've learned to enjoy using.
