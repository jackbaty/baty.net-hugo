Sooo, I thought I [wanted a new theme](/posts/2025/12/i-think-i-want-a-new-theme/) but that didn't work out, so I changed my mind and decided to go back to my old PaperMod theme. Trouble is, that theme was made for Hugo[^1], so I _also_ had to move things back to Hugo. Had to! 😀

I like PaperMod well enough. It's not the full-post-on-home-page I was looking for, but its excerpt handling is good enough for who it's for.

One positive side effect is build times. Zola takes up to 12 seconds to render the site. Hugo takes 1.5 seconds. That's a meaningful difference.

So, we're doing Hugo for now. Sorry about your RSS feeds!


[^1]: There is a clone of PaperMod built for Zola, but I'm skeptical, so I passed on it.
