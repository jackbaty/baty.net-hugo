How about this for a resolution... Don't change blogging platforms more than once a quarter.

Ha!

I sometimes wish playing with tools wasn't so much fun. It would be better, I think, to write more, tinker less. Except that I mostly write about tinkering, so that's sort of self-defeating, no?

Let's recap.

2025 was comprised of Kirby, Ghost, WordPress, Hugo, Zola, Eleventy, Blot, Tinderbox, Emacs, and TiddlyWiki. That seems like a lot, even for me.

We're ending the year with [baty.net](https://baty.net) on Hugo, [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net) on Tinderbox, [baty.blog](https://baty.blog) with Blot, and [the lathe](https://rudimentarylathe.org) still built with TiddlyWiki. 

That's too much to manage. I dream of having One True Blog, but we all know that's not happening. Going into 2026, I'm going to try and limit it to 3. This blog, the daily blog, and the wiki. I sometimes wonder why I have both the wiki and daily blogs, but I have never been able to settle on one or the other.

Three blogs seems like plenty to keep me busy. If I can figure out how to not change how they're made every other day[^1], we should be good.
