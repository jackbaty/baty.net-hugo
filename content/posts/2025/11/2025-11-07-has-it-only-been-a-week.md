I started my [CLI app only](https://baty.net/posts/2025/10/cli-and-tui-only-for-november/) experiment at the end of October, meaning that it's been just over a week of nothing but CLI and TUI apps for nearly everything. How's it going?

Well, it's been fun. I suspected it would be, because I've been living in a terminal on and off for decades now. It's not as if terminal apps are new to me. Diving back into them has been a blast.

But here's the thing. Once the novelty wears off, it can become a bit tedious. I _love_ being able to use the keyboard for everything. I just don't want to _have_ to use the keyboard for everything all the time. Sometimes I want to kick back and mouse around for a while. I'm finding that this comes up more often than I expected.

Another drawback to everything-in-a-terminal is that everything looks the same. My email, my notes, my tasks, my files, everything. It's a bunch of similar rectangles and it can become kind of boring.

So, right now, I have mixed feelings about the whole enterprise, but I'm sticking with it for now. Today I'm going to see if I can get LazyVim to calm down and just let me write instead of trying to tell me how to write. (It's probably the whole LSP integration thing).
