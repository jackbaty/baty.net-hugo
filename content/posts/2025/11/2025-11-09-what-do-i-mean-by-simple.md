For nearly two years I've been telling myself to [Reduce & Simplify](/posts/2023/12/reduce-and-simplify/). For short periods, I've almost done that, but entropy takes over and I once again overcomplicate everything.

Could the problem be that I'm not sure what I mean by "Simple"?

One day, it feels simple to use only Emacs and a browser on Linux installed on boring hardware. The next day, simple means using the default Notes, Mail, and Reminders app on macOS. Then on another day, a notebook and pen are my definition of "simple". What happens is that I end up alternating between all of these so-called simple workflows, and I'm back to chaos.

Simple is "One camera, one lens". But which camera and which lens? If I change my mind every other day, it's no longer one camera, one lens. It's definitely not simple.

Maybe I'm incapable of simplifying. Maybe what I'm doing now is as simple as it gets. I hope not, because what I'm doing now is crazy-making.

What I'd think simplification looks like for me:

- Linux or macOS? Pick one and run with it. If I still need macOS for scanning or something, turn the Mac into an appliance for only doing that. Stop this waffling.
- Choose 3 cameras. One for the pocket, everywhere. One for when I'm out and don't mind carrying a camera. One for "serious" work. I don't think I can limit it further than that.
- One notebook. OK, maybe two notebooks. One for logging/planning and one as a personal journal.

The problem might be that I want to be one kind of person, but I'm actually a different kind of person. They are incompatible.

Still, it's worth a try.

P.S. I'm typing this in NeoVim because maybe that's simpler than using Emacs? 🙄
