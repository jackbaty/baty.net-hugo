It's been the kind of day where using (or trying to use) Emacs frustrates me.

I've spent the past few weeks adapting my custom Emacs configuration to work on Linux. I was so confident that I would be moving to Linux that I ignored anything that might not work cross-platform. I should know better.

Today I was using my Mac and fired up Emacs and of course nothing worked. I spent nearly 2 hours futzing with it and I still don't know what's gone wrong. Reviewing Git commits hasn't narrowed it down, either. It's not the fact that I broke Emacs, it's more that I'm so capable of breaking Emacs at any time. I do it more than I care to. I'm not in the mood, ya know?

My mood today has been less than festive, so my problems with Emacs just made a bad thing worse, so I quit Emacs in a huff.

I installed the [MiniMax](https://nvim-mini.org/MiniMax/) configuration for NeoVim and I am typing this post using it. I didn't write a line of configuration and I didn't tweak a thing. It's working fine, for now.

MiniMax isn't as fancy as [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim), but it's also not as seizure-inducing by default. It strikes a nice balance between friendly and frenzied.

It's not like I'm switching permanently back to Vim, but when I'm mad at Emacs, this NeoVim setup is pretty nice. Sometimes Emacs and I get into a destructive relationship, and we take a little break. That's probably all this is.
