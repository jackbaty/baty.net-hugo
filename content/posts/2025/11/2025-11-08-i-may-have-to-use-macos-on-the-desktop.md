I'm trying to get everything running smoothly on the Linux machines. I really am. And I'm close, but I'm not there yet, and I'm not sure if I'll ever get there.

Many of the apps I use on macOS are also available on Linux. This is awesome. It's the ones I love, but need to leave behind that are causing all the trouble.

Most of the problems are around photo processing. I've spent many (many!) hours learning and testing [Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) for RAW processing. It's a powerful tool with a lot of clever ideas, some of which I actually prefer to its Mac counterparts. However, Darktable is not at all pleasant to use. Once the cleverness and new-shiny factors are past, I'm forced to live in a clumsy, awkward, unpleasant, unattractive environment. I miss [Capture One](https://www.captureone.com/en) dearly. Capture One gets me results I like quickly and easily. It's better.

Then there's scanning. I've spent years wrangling [SilverFast](https://www.silverfast.com/) to a point where I don't hate it. Recent updates have introduced the feature of scanning multiple (3, in my case) frames at once, making it much faster. I used to use Vuescan, and it's available on Linux, so I tried it. So so slow. And it does a pretty poor job with color film.

With digital camera scans, nothing beats [Negative Lab Pro](https://www.negativelabpro.com/) for doing inversions. NLP requires Lightroom Classic, so I'm kind of stuck there. I tried the Negadoctor feature of Darkroom and, while feasible, inversions are slow and tedious.

Photography is not just something I tinker with occasionally. It's my most enjoyable hobby. I don't think I want to suffer through it, just so I can use Linux.

There are several other apps that I seriously miss from macOS. [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) is still unbeatable for ease of use, stability, and capabilities when it comes to manipulating text. [Tinderbox](https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox) is one of a kind for outlining and notes. There's nothing on Linux comparable with [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) for task management. And so on.

But the deal-breaking omission might be Messages. Everyone I communicate with regularly uses Apple Messages and Facetime, exclusively. I can't stand typing on my phone, so having to hear an alert, grab my phone, and fumble my way through a reply is maddening. Also, I can't quickly send people links or photos from where I am. How am I supposed to share that hilarious meme if it's so much effort?

On the other hand, I love using the Framework laptop when away from my desk. I like the keyboard better than the MacBook Air's. Knowing I can easily upgrade or fix things (inexpensively) for years is very compelling.

So all this to say that I may end up using a Mac on the desktop and Linux on the laptop. I swore I'd never do that again. Between sync, paths, configuration issues, filename case mismatches, and wildly different key bindings, using both is a royal pain in the ass.

This rambling post is just me working through all of this. I'm typing this post using BBEdit on the Mac Mini, and I gotta say that having the standard Emacs keybindings everywhere is a compelling case for macOS for me.

I'll keep you posted.
