I've become a bit overwhelmed by text after using mostly CLI/TUI tools for the past few weeks. I need a break from looking at tedious walls of text all day, so instead of creating posts here using Markdown, I'm posting to my WordPress blog over at [baty.blog](https://baty.blog) for a while[^1]. I needed a change of venue. Hope to see you there!

[^1]: I don't know what I mean by "a while", so don't go too far.
