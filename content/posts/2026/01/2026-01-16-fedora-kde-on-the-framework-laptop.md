summary: I've been surprised to learn that I prefer KDE to Gnome
---

When I was setting up my desktop computer with Linux, I wanted to install Gnome, but I couldn't get itto work with the Apple Studio Display. I went with KDE instead, and put Gnome on the laptop.

After using both for a couple weeks, it turns out I prefer KDE. This morning, I wiped the Framework and installed KDE. It took me a couple of hours to get to a point where I could do most of the things I normally do (write this post, for example).

I didn't take detailed notes, but I did list all of the things I've done so far. I'm putting it here for safe keeping. I keep threatening to make this into a script, but honestly I'd rather just run through it manually each time.
