In [How about some blogging stability for 2026?](https://baty.net/posts/2025/12/how-about-some-blogging-stability-for-2026/) I wrote that I resolved to not change blogging platforms more than once a quarter. This would be an easy goal for most people. For me, though, it's a bit of a challenge.

I was bored this morning, which is never a good sign. For something to do, instead of changing platforms, I decided to change Hugo themes instead. Totally within the boundaries, right?

Anyway, we're trying the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme. It's a derivative of the old Congo theme that I quite liked before it was mostly abandoned. Moving themes with Hugo is never simple, but I think the only thing I've lost are featured images. In PaperMod, they're controlled with front matter. In Blowfish, it's done via naming convention. This means that any of my old posts that have cover images I'd like to keep, I need to rename the image files. It's easy, but will be tedious so I'm just going to pick at them over time.

Instead of simply changing the "theme" configuration setting, I created a whole new site by copying everything over from the PaperMod version. This is probably doing things the hard way, but it feels less like a permanent move. If it turns out I don't love the new theme, I can just copy over a couple of new post markdown files and deploy the old version. I like to keep my options open.
