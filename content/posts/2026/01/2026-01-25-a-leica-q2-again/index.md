Well the entire Leica SL2 kit has been sold, which left me with the GRIII as my only digital camera. I love the little Ricoh, but it doesn't scratch my "Go out and take photos" itch.

I've gone back to a [Leica Q2](https://leica-camera.com/en-US/photography/cameras/q/q2-black). I have previously owned a Q, Q2, and Q2 Monochrom, but eventually sold them due to other urges (mostly for digital M cameras).

Lately I've been wanting something smaller for carrying everywhere. The SL2 is ginormous and heavy. The Q2 isn't exactly _tiny_, but it's much easier to have with me than the SL2. I could have gone smaller with something like a Fuji, or even the GRIII, but I decided to stick with the Leica. I'll still have the GRIII for when I don't feel like carrying a camera, but the Leica goes everywhere else.

28mm is challenging for me, but I'm unashamed to crop when needed, and the 47MP gives me plenty of leeway. The 1.7 Summilux is a great lens. The clever macro switch is a joy to use. It's easy and intuitive to switch to manual focusing, which I do a lot. I can live with 28mm.

Add weather sealing, IBS, and super simple button/menu layouts, and it really is a winning combination.

I admit being tempated by the newer Q3, but new ones cost $7,000, and even used copies are still twice what I paid for the Q2. I got a very good deal on my camera, so I'm happy with that.

I like not having to decide which digital camera or which lenses to bring every time I leave the house.
