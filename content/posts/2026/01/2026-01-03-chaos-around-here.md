I'm typing this in NeoVim on the Framework running Fedora/Gnome. Earlier today, I fired up the Mac Mini and thought, "Man, this is how I want to do computing." This, in direct opposition to how I've felt about it for the past few months. As part of the new year, I'd "decided" that I was putting the Linux experiment on hold indefinitely. I'd fired up Tinderbox for blogging at daily.baty.net as part of my new move back to macOS. 

None of these things stick. I'm about to shut down this laptop and move over too the Mac Mini running Tahoe and remind myself why I don't want to live there. It _seems_ like somewhere I'd like to live. Do I really want to not have control over my operating system? Do I want to live with Liquid Glass even though I hate it?

Anyway, like I said, chaos[^1].
