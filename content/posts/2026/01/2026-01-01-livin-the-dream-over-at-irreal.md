Over at Irreal, [Blogging Platforms](https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13511):

> For me, blogging is all about writing and sharing my discoveries. The last thing I want is to worry about is my blogging platform. I want it to be as transparent as possible so I don’t have to think about it. I just want to write my post in Org mode and push a button to publish it.

Most days, this is what I dream of, too. Picking something and sticking with it would be good for me. So far, I've not been able to do that, even for a short time it seems. Maybe 2026 will be the year! :)
