My laptop has been running Fedora's KDE spin. I first tried the stock Fedora with Gnome, but since my desktop was running KDE, I figured I should standardize on that.

Standardization is boring. :)

I installed Fedora Workstation this morning. I'd taken notes from the last time, and those helped speed things along. Still, it was 2 hours from installer to a fully functional system. I'm typing this post in Emacs and will deploy Hugo shortly.

For the record, here are my raw notes from the installation. I need to work on the order in which I do things, but this wasn't bad.

```

Since the laptop is meant to be a sort of satellite computer orbiting my desktop Mac Mini, I don't need _everything_ installed. The above covers just the basics.

One day I should write a script that takes care of this for me.
