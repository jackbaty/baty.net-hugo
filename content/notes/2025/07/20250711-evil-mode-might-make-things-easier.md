I swore off Evil-mode in Emacs a while ago. It often feels like a kludge and some packages I use, namely [Howm](https://github.com/kaorahi/howm), don't work with it at all. But I still spend time in a terminal, terminal apps, and Vim, and bouncing between Vim and Emacs bindings is crazy-making and I'm not enjoying it.
