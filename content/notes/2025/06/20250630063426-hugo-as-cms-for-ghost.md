Here's a stupid idea I'm thinking about trying. What if I were to write all my posts in Emacs and render them locally using Hugo. Then, copy and paste the rendered HTML into the Ghost editor for publishing? A bonus with that approach would be that when I inevitably end up back to using Hugo for the blog, all the content will already be there 😁.
