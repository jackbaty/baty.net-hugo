People seem to compare the hype around AI/LLM use to that of Blockchain/NFT from a couple of years ago. The difference for me is that I don't personally know anyone who cared at all about blockchain, whereas _everyone_ I know is using and is amazed by AI tools. Sure it's still over-hyped, but at least it deserves some of it.
