To publish this note, I had to:

- Share my ~/sites directory from the Mac via Syncthing
- Install Go
- Install Hugo
- Install just
- Tweak some paths in my init-hugo.el
- Authenticate with Github

It took me about 15 minutes. Linux, and especially [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org), continues to impress. If you're reading this, it all worked.
