[Greg Storey, Slop doesn’t slop itself](https://brilliantcrank.com/slop-doesnt-slop-itself/):

> If people genuinely put forth the effort to avoid digital distractions and actually create and make—not as a lifestyle hack, but simple decision making—then we’d have a much better place to live and work. Slop is deliberate, not inevitable.

Well if what we need is for people to "put forth the effort" then I guess slop _is_ inevitable.
