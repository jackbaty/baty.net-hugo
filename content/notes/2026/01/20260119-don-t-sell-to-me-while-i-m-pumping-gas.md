I went to my regular gas station yesterday.  I was happy to see that they'd upgraded their pumps and now take Apple Pay. They also added giant screens that show me ads and play elevator jazz while I'm pumping gas. That's the last time I'm going to that gas station. I'll drive 20 miles out of town to find one that doesn't talk to me.
