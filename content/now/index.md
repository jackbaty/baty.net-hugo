# What I'm doing Now

Here are a few things I’m doing or learning or playing with these days[^thx]

Updated on Sunday, January 4, 2026.

- Very close to going all-in with Linux (Currently KDE on Fedora)
- Learning to use Darktable to process photos.
- Testing [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) on Linux since I can't have BBEdit
