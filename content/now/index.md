# What I'm doing Now

Here are a few things I’m doing or learning or playing with these days[^thx]

- Trying to go all-in with Linux (Namely Arch via Omarchy)
- Back into TiddlyWiki over at [rudimentarylathe.org](https://rudimentarylathe.org).
- Blogging in at least two places, against my better judgement.
