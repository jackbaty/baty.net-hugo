# What I'm doing Now

Here are a few things I’m doing or learning or playing with these days[^thx]

- Very close to going all-in with Linux (Currently KDE on Fedora)
- Learning to use Darktable to process photos. (or _trying_ to)
- Testing [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) on Linux since I can't have BBEdit
